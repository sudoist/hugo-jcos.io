# jcos.io on Hello Friend NG
My personal site.

Decided to drop WordPress after outdated theme does not work with latest version.

Searching around for new themes then come upon Hugo.

Going static for now.


This theme was built on top of [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng)
