#### Hello, my name is John Cosio.

I’m a programmer, webmaster and all-around computer guy.

I build websites from simple blog pages to complicated E-commerce sites.

***

Java is not my cup of…. water. Not much of a coffee or tea drinker.

Too complicated for me and back in college I used to skip classes. hahahaha

Not funny? Okay, let’s forget that happened. :smile:

#### More about me and what I do

##### Writing

I write things about everything that gets my interest and rants. Maybe some rants…..

##### Gaming

My addiction and enthusiasm with computer games started when I was very little.

I’ve started a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHhhzP8dUEp_PS9eNUU2-A) to upload gameplay and other game related contents.

##### Development

Check out my snippets and projects I’m building on [Github](https://github.com/sudoist).

I’m planning to contribute in the development of Open Source software I regularly use.

##### Artsy stuff

My take take on things around me and adding a little twist to common words and sentences.

I draw puns inspired by [Chris Butler collection](http://www.chrisbutlercollection.com/just-for-pun) and funny comics from the [The Oatmeal](http://theoatmeal.com/).

Edit photos of [Gundams](categories/gunpla/ "Gunpla") to make it look cool then probably hand paint them later.

Shoot picturesque [scenery](posts/islas-de-gigantes/islas-de-gigantes/ "Photography") with my handy phone. (Pretty much hit and miss)
