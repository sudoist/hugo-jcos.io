#### Model Kit: [SD Gundam EX-Standard Wing Gundam Zero EW](#)

So after looking around on how to paint and what best way to do this, I ended up coloring and working on this using my computer.

This is the previous SD we built – [Wing Gundam EW](#)

## Before

## After

Cleaned up some nubs, changes colors and a lot more easier done.

Pros of using computer

- Cheaper I didn’t have to buy any paint
- Faster, it is seen asap. Does not need to wait for paint to dry.
- Can look really good depending on skill level. (Still starting out, my second shot at this)
- Can easily remove nubs as well

Cons

- Can’t really display the finished product since only digital
- Sometimes it’s hard to use mouse with drawings
- That’s all I can think for now

### Helpful video I saw so far which I used for reference

{{< youtube 8ZRbiXk-nJo >}}

He does toy photography tutorials and stuff.

Tools for editing

- GIMP

GIMP because it’s free and this is only a hobby I do when there’s time to spare so no need for Photoshop.

Yeah that’s it for now. Just a lot of googling and see what looks good.
