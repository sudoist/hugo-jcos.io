### Still Sane Exile?

After years of being an exile, diving deep into Wraeclast’s unforgiving world, the time has finally come to venture into the highly-anticipated Path of Exile 2.

The hype is real, and the countdown has begun—I’ll be jumping in within just a few hours.

### Early Access: It’s Finally Here

I’m thrilled to have secured early access to Path of Exile 2.

This is my first ever game to pre order buy an early access key.

Like many of you, I’ve already preloaded the game on Steam. As the download progresses, I can’t help but reminisce about my long journey through Path of Exile.

From the moment I first stepped into the Talisman League, to recently wrapping up the Settlers of Kalguur League with my best performance ever—36/40 challenges completed!

It’s been a wild and rewarding ride, and I’m ready for the next one.

### Going In Raw: The Witch Awaits

For my first foray into PoE2, I’ve decided to stick with my favorite class(The Witch) and lean into a minion build.

True to my style, I’m going in raw this time: no guides, no meta-checking, just pure exploration and improvisation in SSF.

There’s something incredibly liberating about letting the game surprise you, especially with the rich complexity GGG is known for.

### Anticipation and Excitement

I’m wishing everyone heading into the game today the best of luck and hope that PoE2 lives up to our expectations.

Grinding Gear Games has a track record of delivering deep, immersive experiences, so I’m optimistic that this next chapter will be nothing short of incredible.

Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, may your loot be plentiful and your RNG kind.

### A Message to Fellow Exiles

If you’re downloading the game right now, just like me, let’s share this moment of excitement together.

The years of waiting and speculating are over—it’s time to carve our names into the annals of Wraeclast once again.

Let’s go, exiles, and make this journey unforgettable.

I’ll see you in Path of Exile 2. LOG IN.
