This is my first take on painting with GIMP.

{{<image src="gimp-sd-deathscythe-ew/scaled_deathscythe-p1_kbhaah.png">}}

Tried editing the background out and replacing with space.

Subject is the Gundam Deathscythe-Hell EW version.

Practicing adding glowing things to eyes and the scythe.

## Before

## After

I got some more posts coming up. Cleaning up the Gundam Crossbones and working on the SD Sinanju.

Still 2 more SD then moving on to my MG kit or get some HG for practice.

This is actually quite relaxing. Haven’t opened Steam in a while.
