Recently I got laid off, It's not all that bad because I have some more free time now.

Take this time to take a break but not until the point it eats up my savings. (I think I'll be good for a couple of months, should have saved like an ant.)

Oh and my [Upwork page](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~01e9d0d8b8a4b0a844/) is still alive so you can hire me from there.

Still considering to be a full-time freelancer but there are more cons than being employed but hey it is welcome.

I figured it's not for me. I can't sell myself well yet but practice will make it eventually.

For my real resume and want to contact me for work, please visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncosio/).

I'm clearing my game [backlog](https://backloggery.com/sudoist), binging anime on Netflix, updating my resume and making fictional one like this one.

There's this [Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Wars!:_Shokugeki_no_Soma) I watched before until Season 2 then finished the two new seasons. It's still fun even though I finished the manga.

I was thinking of this for a while and listed in a Trello board. Some years ago.

These companies or groups that messed up the world or shady in a way.

Wow... That intro was lengthy than I expected, enough of my ramblings let's get to it.

## I wrote the companies and moved to another post.

### Remember this is just a figment of my imagination.

What do you think about my portfolio? Pretty awesome right?

Again if you are still here. Thanks a lot!

Appreciate your time.

Hope you enjoyed this mishmash as well as I enjoyed writing it.
