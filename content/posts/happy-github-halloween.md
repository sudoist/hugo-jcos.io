## Happy Halloween!

It's that time for job hunting again.

Nothing much going right now, working on my previous project for laundry app and porting to multiple frameworks to show prospective employers.

As always I'm placing a Nen limitation on myself to not play any games until I get a new job. (Second or third time doing this)

No noeed to stretch this out, that's all.

Trick or Treats!
