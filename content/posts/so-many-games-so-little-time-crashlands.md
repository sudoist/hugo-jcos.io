Hey there! Just finished Crashlands. I really enjoyed every session and lost some sleep. Just one more recipeee!!!
Crashlands was released in 2016, I was pretty late for the party but no worries still got to play it. It went on sale some time ago on Steam and Google play so I went with the Android version since I thought I might be able to play that more often(Also cheaper).

## **Gameplay**

The game focuses on crafting and battles to get items needed for crafting. Seems really simple but there is a lot to it.

On later stages the game could get a little grindy but not to the point that it feels like a slog.

There are lots to do in the games. Craft stuff, craft weapons, furniture and more.

## **Story**

Main character is Flux Dabes, She is a she but I was it was in the middle of the game where I realized that.

Bet she&#8217;s hot under that infinisuit. She is a shipping expert and the story mostly revolves around delivering the packages.

Another important character is Juicebox the robot that allows follows you around. Juicebox&#8217;s dialogues are entertaining and hilarious.

I also like the pacing of the story. Feels about right.

## **TLDR**

If you are thinking about playing a new game with great fun story and can keep you entertained for hours get this game now. Even better when on sale but It&#8217;s worth it. There are also some achievements/perks among other ButterScotch games.

There&#8217;s also a nice story of how they start up working on Crashlands.

Thinking of adding gameplay videos here on another post.

That&#8217;s all for now.

Until next game, bye!
